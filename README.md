# Udacity C++ Nanodegree

We are trying to create our own smart pointer -- trying to clone it. We need to keep track of how many times the pointer is pointing to memory. We will keep track with a reference counter.

The class Pointer contains a list.
What is it a list of? It says it's a list of ref counts. So does that mean it's a list of ints? It also says that each element in the list is wrapped in a PtrDetails class. This class holds the refCount of that element. What?

## `Project: Memory Management aka Garbage-Collector`

The goal of this project is to learn and development memory management in C++ by creating my own Smart Pointer -- in other words, to create a garbage collector.

Starter code for this project is provided by Udacity [here](https://github.com/udacity/CppND-Garbage-Collector)
